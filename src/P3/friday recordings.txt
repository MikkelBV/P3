video 1 + 2:
dist to camera = 15m \\ 1500cm
runner distance (middle of first lamp to white pole at door) = 13,2m \\ 1320cm
vid 1 time = 3,20 sec \\speed = 13,2 / 3,20 = 4,125m/s
vid 2 time = 4 sec \\speed = 13,2 / 4 = 3,3m/s

video 3:
dist to camera = 8m \\ 800cm
runner distance (first stripe to last strip in the middle row of stones) = 7,2m \\ 720cm
time = 1,9sec \\ speed = 7,2 / 1,9 = 3,7m/s
